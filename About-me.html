    <p>  I am Poh Jun Zhe Matthew it is my full name, but you can call me Matthew Poh for short. I am currently in the S1-08 class, studying at SST(School of Science and Technology).</p>
    <H3>Beginnings</H3>
    <p>  I was born on December 16, 2012. Since young, I was obsessed with Polar bears(They're cub is very cute!ðŸ¥°).In primary 4, I started programming. I started with scratch as it was simple and good for beginners who wanted to code; I would normally go to the library to borrow scratch programming books in the children's section of the library. After programming with scratch for a while, I stumbled upon <a href="https://ineasysteps.com/products-page/coding-with-html-javascript-create-epic-computer-games/">coding with HTML javascript create epic computer games/</a>book which started to spark my interest into programming. Within a few days, I was able to create my first HTML website. My interest did not stop there, I decided to go to the adult section of the library. I was curious about how to program in Java and decided to read a book about it.</p>
    <H3>Why Java?</H3>
    <ul>
      <li>Firstly, it is an OOP(object-oriented programming) language meaning that you can create custom classes for your program.</li>
      <li>Secondly, it compiles on JVM(Java Virtual Machine), which means that you can run it on every type of device including Mac.</li>
      <li>Thirdly, it has a cute mascot:Duke. :D</li>
      <li>Lastly, it is one of my most favourite game (Minecraft) programming language</li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Back to beginnings</H3>
    <p>  All right back to talking about my beginnings, I started learning basic syntax and stuff. A simple program showing some basic programming in Java :<br>
      <pre>
      <code>
Main.java
public class Main{
  static void main(String[] args){
    //Basic hello world program
    System.out.println("Hello,world");
    //OUTPUT:
    //Hello,world
    //Basic addition
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    System.out.println(x+y);//3
    //Basic subtraction
    System.out.println(y-x);//1
    //Basic Multiplication
    System.out.println(x*y);//2
    //Basic division
    System.out.println(x/y);//0.5
  }
}
      </code>
      </pre><br>I soon learnt some basic Java GUI like Java awt and swing. A simple program showing a Java awt Frame and a Java swing frame Both saying Hello world<br>
  <pre>
  <code>
import java.awt.*;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Frame frame = new Frame();
        Label label = new Label("Hello world");
        frame.setSize(100,100);
        frame.add(label);
        frame.setVisible(true);
        frame.addWindowListener(new WindowAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void windowClosing(WindowEvent e) {
                frame.dispose();
            }
        });
        JFrame jFrame = new JFrame();
        JLabel jLabel = new JLabel("Hello world");
        jFrame.add(jLabel);
        jFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        jFrame.setSize(100,100);
        jFrame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
  </code>
  </pre>Not before long, it was 2023, and I was primary 5ðŸ¥³.Soon, I learnt the python programming language a simple programming language that is easy to pick up. Simple program showcasing the basics of python.<br>
  <pre>
  <code>
#Hello,world
print("Hello,world")
#Addition
x = 1
y = 2
print(x+y)#3
#Subtraction
print(y-x)#1
#Multiplication
print(x*y)#2
#Divition
print(x/y)#0.5
  </code>
  </pre>
  <br>I kinda forgot what I did mostly in 2023, so I skipped it. Moving on!->2024!It's our last year in primary school.We're taking PSLE, it was totally so much fun! At the front of 2024, I learnt about pygame, and how it is useful.I created a game called Clonepaint where you can clone yourself across the canvas and spread your creativity(It was a part-time project). I presented it to my DSA to enter into SST. About between there, I started to learn Luau for Roblox scripting. It was actually kinda fun, learning was easy as the docs where kinda better than those boring docs and the syntax is as easy as Python. PSLE! Yay so fun! All I during that period is more studying.</p>
